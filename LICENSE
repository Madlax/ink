                                   Preamble



The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package
may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains control over the
development of the Package, while giving the users of the package the right
to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus
the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

    "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
    Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through
    modification.

    "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
    or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright
    Holder as specified below.

    "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights
    for the package.

    "You" is you or the organisation that you represent, if you are thinking
    about copying or distributing this Package.

    "Distribution fee" is a fee that you charge for providing a copy of this
    Package to another party.

    "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the right to use the
    item.  It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
    under the same conditions they received it.


DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
   Standard Version of the Package, provided that:

   a) You retain all of the original copyright notices and associated
      disclaimers.

   b) You do not claim ownership of the Package, regardless of whether or
      not it has been modified.

2. You may not charge a distribution fee, licensing fee, or make any other
   form of profit when distributing the Package, regardless of whether or not
   it has been modified.

3. Larger Works: You may distribute the Package alongside other works on the
   same distribution media, such as a CDROM.  Fees are permitted with respect
   to the larger work without breaching the limitations in clause 2 of this
   agreement.  However, You must be able to produce a Freely Available copy
   of the distributed Package at no charge to any individual that requests
   it, within 7 days of the receipt of such requests.  This license must be
   included with the distribution so that the recipient is adequately
   informed as to their rights with respect to this Package.

4. You may distribute the Package in compiled form, provided that you
   accompany the distribution with the source code of the Package with your
   modifications, OR provide a reference to the modified source code at a
   publicly accessible location on the Internet. All of the aforementioned
   distribution rights are in effect when distributing a compiled version of
   the Package.


DEVELOPMENT TERMS

5. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
   from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from the
   Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be
   considered the Standard Version.  The Copyright Holder will not be held
   liable in the event that your modifications are in breach of the
   intellectual property or patented works of another entity.  You are solely
   responsible for ensuring that your actions are within the laws of your
   country and that of the Copyright Holder(s).

6. In accordance with any modifications that are made, you must insert a
   prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed
   that file.  You must place your modifications in the Public Domain by
   making them Freely Available through the Internet with unrestricted access
   to them, or by asking the Copyright Holder to include your modifications
   in the Standard Version of the Package.

7. Any Program that is linked to the Package via indirect means (i.e.
   run-time linking) shall not be considered part of the Package.  If you
   compile the Package into a larger Program (e.g. by static linking, or by
   inclusive compilation) then the entire Program shall fall under the terms
   of this license agreement and inherit all of its stated conditions.  If
   this license is in conflict with any existing terms associated with the
   larger Program, then you may not merge the two together.

8. Any data that is output from the programs of the Package will not
   automatically fall under the copyright of the Package, but belong to
   whoever or whomever is responsible for generating that data (assuming
   said output is of original content and does not infringe upon existing
   copyright material).
